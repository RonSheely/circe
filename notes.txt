todo:

- schematic: 
    moving items need to support different snap grids depending on element type - e.g. line vs port in device designer
    vertical/horizontal mirroring
    area selection - contains and intersects by selection area is positive/negative
    connect devices with wire if ports overlap
    wire snapping to ports and visual indicator
    ctrl-z/undo/redo
    wiring pathfinder
    gui toolbar
    grabbing (moves devices while keeping wire connections)
    click-drag-move for wires (reroute based on new coord)

- designer:
    line segment edit - drag/drop end points
    arc drawing (nor, nand gates curved portion)
    serde save graphics
    device saving/loading, device libraries
    ports need to snap to integer

- circuit:
    custom net labels
    circuit add device submenu - d to bring up menu, r/v/g to place respective device
    improved parameters editor

- immediate: 
    zooming during device placement visual bug - maybe selection system not a good fit, or just flag phantom devices to not draw?

    clean up colors, use iced theme?

- medium term:
    build script to copy ngspice.dll into directory

    logging

    use pane_grid from iced
    
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    schematic checking - mark floating nets, ports

- long term:
    custom net names
    nets highlighting/color cycling

    bypass iced, tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling (maybe?)

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support
