todo:

- schematic: 
    reversible rotation direction
    vertical/horizontal mirroring
    area selection - contains and intersects by selection area is positive/negative
    device/wire copy/paste
    connect devices with wire if ports overlap
    wire snapping to ports and visual indicator
    ctrl-z/undo/redo
    wiring pathfinder
    gui toolbar
    grabbing (moves devices while keeping wire connections)
    click-drag-move for wires (reroute based on new coord)

- designer:
    arc drawing (nor, nand gates curved portion)
    serde save graphics
    place ports, device saving/loading, device libraries

- architectural:
    rework viewport integration
    viewport: 
        common functionality between device designer/schematic
        viewport controls should not intefer with schematic controls. e.g. panning should not reset device placement

    modules which will be used by both device designer and schematic (e.g. ports) need to be reorganized

- immediate: 
    zooming during device placement visual bug - maybe selection system not a good fit, or just flag phantom devices to not draw?

    clean up colors, use iced theme?

- medium term:
    build script to copy ngspice.dll into directory

    logging

    use pane_grid from iced
    
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    schematic checking - mark floating nets, ports

- long term:
    custom net names
    nets highlighting/color cycling

    bypass iced, tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling (maybe?)

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support
