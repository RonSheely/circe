todo:

- schematic: 
    moving items need to support different snap grids depending on element type - e.g. line vs port in device designer
    connect devices with wire if ports overlap
    wire snapping to ports and visual indicator
    ctrl-(shift)-z undo/redo

- designer:
    line segment edit - drag/drop end points
    device saving/loading, device libraries

- circuit:
    custom net labels, net highlighting
    circuit add device submenu - d to bring up menu, r/v/g to place respective device
    improved parameters editor
    gui toolbar
    wiring pathfinder - needs some work/tuning, optimization, lags on longer/complicated paths. Should allow direct s-b connections on mosfets
    grabbing (moves devices while keeping wire connections, pending wiring pathfinder)
    click-drag-move for wires (reroute based on new coord, pending pathfinder)
    consider adding layers trait (devices layer, nets layer, etc.)

- immediate: 
    zooming during device placement visual bug - maybe selection system not a good fit, or just flag phantom devices to not draw?
    
    clean up colors, use iced theme?

- medium term:
    build script to copy ngspice.dll into directory

    logging

    use pane_grid from iced
    
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    schematic checking - mark floating nets, ports

- long term:
    bypass iced, tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling (maybe?)

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support
