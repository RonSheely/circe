Page - elements/widget layout which may contain a viewport
    Viewport - impl iced canvas, grid, panning, fit view etc
        Schematic - impl schematic functions - selection, cycle, move, copy etc over generic elements
            Content - concrete types implmenting specialized functions (Circuit, DeviceDesigner)
        DataGraph - impl plot functions - horz/vert markers, etc.
            Plot - concrete types containing data

Content <-> Page communication - how to do this?
Content/Plot is a member of Page
Viewport gets a reference

add another layer
viewport <-> schematic/plot <-> content
viewport: zoom, pan, etc.
schematic: translate, copy, delete generic selected
plot: data plots
content: concrete elements which can be selected or moved
